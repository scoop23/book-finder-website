sponty (spontaneuous) website, just messing around react trying to make a book finder website. hopefully with some backend stuff. 

i regret designing this, might change the design.

TODO:
 - actions buttons e.g like, bookmark, add to favorites, view details modal
 - fix pagination. might replace google books api and use openlibrary api instead.
