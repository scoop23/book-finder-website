# Bookiverse
 - A simple book finder website where you can like, bookmark or see details about books from all over the world (limited by google books api), i got this idea when i was reading books online.

### CUSTOM UI
 - my goal is to understand react UI development although i think these days react ui libraries matters more. but its fun so i will continue to built it customly. 

### TODO:
 - actions buttons e.g like, bookmark, add to favorites, view details modal
 - fix pagination. might replace google books api and use openlibrary api instead.
 - make a homepage 
 - make a profilepage
 - make a bookdetailspage

### LEARNED / WILL DO:
 - don't just assign class selectors to all divs or whatnot, consider if it will be a id. change it bro.
