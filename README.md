## CUSTOM UI
 - my goal is to understand react UI development although i think these days react ui libraries matters more. but its fun so i will continue built it customly. 

## TODO:
 - actions buttons e.g like, bookmark, add to favorites, view details modal
 - fix pagination. might replace google books api and use openlibrary api instead.

## LEARNED / WILL DO:
 - don't just assign class selectors to all divs or whatnot, consider if it will be a id. change it bro.
